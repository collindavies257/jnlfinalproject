        <h1>Western Housing Boom</h1>
        <p>Housing Markets Out West Have Boomed During the Pandemic</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>It’s no secret that the housing market has boomed during the pandemic. Many Americans are not able to afford homes at their high prices right now, and have been waiting two years, hoping for a market crash to increase affordability.</p>

      <iframe title="United States Home Price Index" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-iUjgd" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iUjgd/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

      <p>This is how the United States real estate market has been shaped on a total level. The home pricing index is the measurement for how valuable homes in the area are. For example, with the index being 100 in 2000, the average home price doubled in April of 2018 because the index was increased to 200.<p>

      <p>A home in 1987 is now valued 4.5 times the amount now. But the real nuance in the data is how sharp the spike was at the beginning of 2020. That rapid of a housing price increase has never happened on record. That is a 25% increase in the span of just two years.</p>

      <p>So, while the U.S. has seen a boom across the board, there is another intriguing aspect to the data. It is the rate in which western states such as Idaho, Utah, and Montana have increased much faster than the rest of the country’s average.</p>

      <iframe title="House Price Index Percentage Increase" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-IXFLw" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IXFLw/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

      <p>The chart above shows the total rate of increase since the very end of 2019-2021. Idaho’s housing market has increased a massive 10% higher than the U.S. average. To put that into perspective, Idaho’s housing market is increasing at a 40% faster rate than the U.S. average.</p>

      <p>The other three states with extraordinary rates included in the chart, Montana, Utah, and Arizona join Idaho in being all connected going from the top to bottom of the United States. The entire region’s housing market has been booming since the start of the pandemic. So, the question comes up… Why?</p>

      <p>The answer comes from a mix of effects of the pandemic. During the pandemic, a lot of Americans were able to work remotely. And those people weren’t in service industry which often pays minimum wage. The population that was able to work remotely was wealthy. Many people took it upon themselves to go work somewhere else in the country.</p>

      <p>This mobility took people to relatively low populated areas of the country such as Idaho and Montana. Once people got there originally to vacation or stay temporally, they realized that they wanted to live there. The amount of money and people that were driven into those states is a big part of why those housing markets have seen historic jumps.</p>

      <p>These historic jumps have also seen these states and other states with similar characteristics become the most valuable housing markets in the country.</p>

      <iframe title="Housing Index" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-AT2Z6" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AT2Z6/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="358"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

      <p>Colorado is up there as well, and it is located in the same region as Utah, Idaho, and Montana.</p>

      <p>Julie Hopkins is a real estate agent in Park City, UT. Park City is one of the hottest housing markets in Utah and throughout the country. It is a mountain town in the Wasatch Mountain Range. It is also home to two of the top ski resorts in the United States which also drives up housing prices as it is a resort town.</p>

      <p>“I would say most people were looking to find a quiet mountain town to come to. A lot of people were escaping cities. I would also say a lot of people were looking for second homes outside of big cities,” said Hopkins.</p>

      <p>The second home approach shows how much money is coming into places like Park City. Being able to sell at high prices and seeing a culture shift in Park City was also a factor that played into a lot of longtime residents leaving.</p>

      <p>“We also found a lot of people that had been longtime residents of Park City for the last 30 years, they saw the change in Park City, they saw this influx of people from big cities, and the culture changing in our small towns. So, we saw a lot of people leaving as well,” said Hopkins.</p>

      <p>With that small town America changing in those states, it is likely that the market will start to level out.</p>

      <p>Those western regions weren’t the only housing markets with an above average uptick. Typical vacation states such as Florida followed suit. Those trends support the claim of people wanted to live where they vacation because they no longer had to live where they work or they were able to buy second homes.</p>

      <iframe title="State Housing Index" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-titlw" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/titlw/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="508"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

      <p>The pandemic shifted many lives and a lot of those impacts are going to be felt forever. The shift in the housing market out west is likely to keep going and it will become more populated than ever before. Development companies have seen these trends and are looking to take advantage of the growth in those states. The American west will change forever.</p>

      <p>With more people leaving to go west, growth on the east coast will likely slow down. This could spell trouble for those economies in the future. Questions will also be asked about whether the gentrification taking place out west is a good long-term solution, and those states will look to adapt to keep their culture, while also accepting the economic boom.</p>
